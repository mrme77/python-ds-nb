# Project Title

Python Data Structures and Notebooks

## Description

This project is part of the Web Mining and Applied NLP (44-620) course, student's name is Pasquale Salomone. The notebook aims at reviewing some python data structures, like lists and dictionaries, as well as the use of loop and conditional statments, and performing mathematical operations without using standard libraries like math or statistics. Here is the link to the Github repository: [Github Repo](https://github.com/mrme77/python-ds-nb).

## Table of contents
### Question 1 
    Modify the Markdown cell above to put your name after "Student Name:"
### Question 2 
    Write code that divides any two numbers, stores the result in a variable, and prints the result with an appropriate label.

### Question 3 
    Using loops (and potentially conditionals), write Python code that prints the factorial of each integer from 1 through 10     (which you can store in a variable if you want). The factorial of an integer is the product of all of the integers of 1 through the number. Print the result with an appropriate label.

### Question 4 
    Write a python function that takes a single parameter and calculates and returns the average (mean) of the values in the parameter (which you may assume is iterable). Show that your function works by printing the result of calling the function on the list in the cell below.

### Question 5 
    Using your mean function above, write a function that calculates the variance of the list of numbers.

### Question 6 
  Create a list with at least 15 elements in it. Use list slicing to print the following:
* The first 5 elements of the list
* The last 5 elements of the list
* The list reversed (hint, show the entire list with a stride of -1)
* Every second element in the list
* Every third element in the list (stride of 3)

### Question 7 
    Build a dictionary that contains the following information about this class (with appropriate names as keys):
* The name
* The course number
* The semester/term in which you are taking this course
* The number of credit hours this course counts for
* A list of the course learning objectives

### Question 8 
    Given the dictionary defined in the code cell below, print the list of level 3 spells the character has.

### Question 9 
    Write code to determine the number of unique elements in the list below. You MUST use a set in finding your solution. Print the number of unique values in the list with an appropriate label.

### Question 10 
    Create a new Jupyter Notebook (the name of the notebook should be your S number). Add a Markdown cell that contains your name. Add a Code cell and write Python that uses loops to draw the following pattern:
-*      *
**    **
***  ***
********

## Installation

To use this project, make sure you have Python 3.8 installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
python --version
```
